Personal tool for running and managing local processes. Useful for local development environments.

## Features

I've been adding features I find useful for day to day my workflow as:

- Start and stop processes from a single UI
- Rich code output (i.e. clickable links)
- Open working directory
- Open IDE

> 🏗️ This is work in progress so more features to come.

## Getting started

At the moment all configuration comes from `processes.json` file. After adding processes to the list just run:

```bash
bun start
```

## Development

```bash
bun dev
```
